# Mutsu

Mutsu is an easy-to-use and flexible test framework for Dyalog APL.

## How to use it 

Write tests that either start with *'Test'* or end with *'_test'* (case insensitive).

```apl
function_test←{'easy'≡'easy'}   
```

If you place your tests inside a namespace (e.g., *Tests*) you can pass that namespace as an argument to Mutsu's test function `Mutsu.RunTests`. This will run all tests in that namespace and give you a test result report:

```apl
      Mutsu.RunTests Tests
Test run on 2024-10-14T15:15:42
Total suites:   1              
Total tests:    1              
Total errors:   0              
Total failures: 0              
Total skipped:  0 
```

There are three helper functions that you can use inside your tests: `Assert`, `Skip` and `Try`. Calling `Mutsu.RunTests` the first time will place these functions inside your test namespaces.

```apl
Assert 2=addOne 1 ⍝ Assert that result matches expected value.

Skip 'This test isn't ready yet.'

2 (11 Try {⍺÷⍵}) 0 ⍝ We expected a Domain error and we got it
```

For more examples on how to use Mutsu see [Usage examples](./docs/UsageExamples.md).

You can of course name your functions however you like, save the report as a text file, stop on errors, add a setup function, and in general modify the behaviour. See [Configuration](./docs/Configuration.md) for default settings and how you can configure them.

## Installation
Mutsu is a Tatin package and can be loaded or installed via Tatin:
